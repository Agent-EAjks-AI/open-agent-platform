# Authentication Fixes Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to fix the authentication system in the Open Agent Platform web application.

## Issues Fixed

1. **Middleware Authentication Checks**

   - The middleware was looking for the wrong cookie name (`sb-auth-token` instead of the Supabase standard `sb-<project-ref>-auth-token`)
   - Added better handling for static asset paths to prevent redirects on resource loading
   - Implemented a more robust authenticated state detection

2. **Supabase Authentication Flow**

   - Created a singleton Supabase client to prevent multiple client instances
   - Improved error handling and logging for authentication operations
   - Added proper environment variable validation
   - Fixed session handling and persistence issues

3. **OAuth Callback Handler**

   - Enhanced error handling in the callback route
   - Improved redirect handling after authentication
   - Fixed the OAuth session exchange process

4. **Environment Variables Setup**

   - Created a dedicated environment variable utility
   - Added validation for required Supabase environment variables
   - Improved error reporting for missing configurations

5. **Sign-in Page Improvements**
   - Added support for error messages from URL parameters
   - Improved redirect handling after successful authentication
   - Enhanced user feedback during the authentication process

## Key Files Modified

1. **Middleware (`/src/middleware.ts`)**

   - Updated authentication detection to work with Supabase's cookie naming convention
   - Improved path filtering to prevent unnecessary redirects

2. **Supabase Implementation**

   - Created `/src/lib/auth/supabase-client.ts` - Singleton client implementation
   - Updated `/src/lib/auth/supabase.ts` - Authentication provider implementation
   - Added `/src/lib/auth/env.ts` - Environment variable utilities

3. **Authentication Pages**

   - Updated sign-in page to handle errors and redirects better
   - Enhanced callback handling in `/src/app/api/auth/callback/route.ts`

4. **Debugging Tools**
   - Added a debugging component at `/src/components/auth/debug.tsx`
   - Created a debug page at `/src/app/debug-auth/page.tsx`

## How to Test the Changes

1. **Normal Sign-In Flow**

   - Go to `/signin` and sign in with your email and password
   - You should be redirected to the home page after successful authentication

2. **Protected Pages**

   - Try to access a protected page while not logged in
   - You should be redirected to the sign-in page
   - After signing in, you should be redirected back to the page you tried to access

3. **Debugging**
   - Visit `/debug-auth` to see the current authentication state
   - Use the debug component to test sign-out functionality

## Configuration Requirements

Ensure your `.env.local` file contains the following variables:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL="https://<your-project-id>.supabase.co"
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY="<your-anon-key>"
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY="<your-service-role-key>"  # Optional, for admin operations
```

These variables can be found in your Supabase project settings under API settings.

## Architecture Notes

The authentication system is designed to be provider-agnostic through the use of interfaces. The current implementation uses Supabase, but the abstraction allows for easy switching to other providers in the future. The key components are:

1. **Authentication Interface** (`/src/lib/auth/types.ts`)

   - Defines the contract for all authentication providers

2. **Supabase Implementation** (`/src/lib/auth/supabase.ts`)

   - Implements the authentication interface using Supabase

3. **Auth Context Provider** (`/src/providers/Auth.tsx`)
   - Provides authentication state to the entire application
   - Can be configured with different authentication providers
